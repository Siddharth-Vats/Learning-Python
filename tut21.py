# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 is", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is", 5-6)
# print("5 * 6 is", 5*6)
# print("5 / 6 is", 5/6)
# print("5 ** 6 is", 5**6)  # exponent operator
# print("15 % 6 is", 15%6)
# print("15 // 6 is", 15//6)  # returns integer value

# Assignment Operators
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x += 7
# print(x)

# Comparision Operators
# i = 8
# print(i==8)
# print(i>=8)
# print(i<=8)
# print(i!=8)

# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or a)
# print(a or b)
    
# Identity Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership Operators
# list = [3,34,32,56,87,64,54,6,45,65,6,546,45,6,564,6,45,6,54,65,6]
# print(34 in list)
# print(3245 not in list)

# Bitwise Operators
print(0 & 1)  # & and sign, | or sign
print(0 | 1)
